HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) AUD_PWM direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (AUD_PWM) connected to this Port, but both were not found.

ULMTCS-2#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits require reduction  
This design uses 2104 control sets (vs. available limit of 8150, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 15 percent. This is at a level where reduction is REQUIRED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 78 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
