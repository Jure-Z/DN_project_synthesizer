2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) AUD_PWM direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (AUD_PWM) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
